ClearScript VBScript in C#
[LychenBASIC](https://github.com/axtens/LychenBASIC) is not cutting-edge; not particularly modern in any way, shape or form; not platform-agnostic; not anything that will make you fall over yourself trying to download, compile and use.

However, as a platform on which to experiment with C#, it's okay. A previous posting, [Action delegate gives Print to VBScript](https://dev.to/bugmagnet/action-delegate-gives-print-to-vbscript-46o8), refers to it, and it uses a technique discussed in another posting, [Adding Assemblies on the fly in C# ClearScript projects](https://dev.to/bugmagnet/adding-assemblies-on-the-fly-to-lychen-2fn7).

Feel free to ignore it as much as you wish.

Meanwhile, I can now run scripts from within the REPL using `RUN "<name of script>"` and I get meaningful error messages if it fails.
